describes the filters as SDSS-primed like for ugriz and Besell like for BV
No Liverpool/RATCam specific total throughput is provided.

Supernova 2005bl has photometry from RATCam that was S-corrected to Bessell-BVRI
The U data was not S-corrected and is the SDSS-like u' filter on RATCam.

The website provides the following disclaimer:
Note that the transmission curves are measured at 20 degrees Centigrade and in a collimated beam,
and therefore will need to be corrected for the actual temperature at the time of observation
and the f/10 beam of the telescope.
