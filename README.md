# SNooPy Filters

This repository contains the filters used by HOSTFLOWS which are not included in SNooPy by default.

## Adding Filters

The `add_filters.py` file can be ran to add these filters in your local installation of SNooPy:

```
git clone https://github.com/HOSTFLOWS/filters_snoopy.git
cd filters_snoopy
conda activate snpy  # activate the environment where you have SNooPy installed
python add_filters.py
```
